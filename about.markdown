Hiya! I’m Alex. I am a software developer based in Taipei, Taiwan.
Here you’ll find informal posts about functional program design, 
distributed systems, databases, or whatever floats my boat, 
for the most part, to help organize my thoughts.

My Chinese name is __莫雷克__ which is romanised as _moleike_.
